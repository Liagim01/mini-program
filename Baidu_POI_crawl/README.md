# README Manual for Baidu POI Crawler Python Program

## Overview

This Python program, named "Baidu POI Crawler", is designed to extract Points of Interest (POI) data from the Baidu Maps API for a specified city. The program fetches and compiles data such as location names, coordinates, and other relevant information about places within the chosen city, making it an invaluable tool for geographical data analysis and mapping projects.

## Features

- **POI Data Extraction**: Gathers detailed information on points of interest from Baidu Maps.
- **Customizable Search Parameters**: Allows users to specify the city and type of POI.
- **Data Storage**: Collects and stores POI data for further analysis or visualization.

## Requirements

- Python environment setup on your machine.
- Baidu Map Open Platform account with a Web API Access Key (AK).
- Required Python libraries: The program depends on several Python libraries, which are listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

## Installation

1. **Python Environment**: Ensure Python is installed on your machine. If not, download and install it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

2. **Clone or Download the Repository**: Get the program files onto your local machine.

3. **Install Dependencies**: Navigate to the program directory in your command line or terminal and run:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   This will install all necessary libraries.

4. **Baidu Map API Key**: Obtain your Baidu Map API Key (AK) by registering on the [Baidu Map Open Platform](https://lbsyun.baidu.com/).

## Usage Instructions

1. **Open Terminal**: Open your command line or terminal.

2. **Navigate to Script Directory**: Use the `cd` command to navigate to the directory where the script is located.

3. **Run the Script**: Execute the script with the necessary parameters:
   ```bash
   python main.py --ak [your_ak] --city [city_name] --poi [poi_name]
   ```
   Replace `[your_ak]` with your Baidu Map API key, `[city_name]` with the target city name, and `[poi_name]` with the desired point of interest category.

## Example Usage

```bash
python main.py --ak abc123def456 --city Beijing --poi restaurant
```

This command will crawl data for restaurants in Beijing using the provided API key.

## Output

The script will output the gathered POI data, which could include names, addresses, coordinates, and other relevant information. This data can be used for various applications such as mapping, analysis, or as part of a larger data collection project.

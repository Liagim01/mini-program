# Simple Stopwatch

This Python script creates a simple stopwatch using the `tkinter` library. It allows you to start, stop, and reset the stopwatch.

## Usage

To use the stopwatch, open your terminal and run the following command:

```bash
python stopwatch.py
```

This will open a graphical user interface (GUI) window displaying the stopwatch.

### Features

- **Start:** Click the "Start" button to begin the stopwatch. The timer will start counting up.
- **Stop:** Click the "Stop" button to pause the stopwatch. You can resume it by clicking "Start" again.
- **Reset:** Click the "Reset" button to reset the stopwatch to 00:00:00.

The stopwatch will display the elapsed time in hours, minutes, and seconds format (HH:MM:SS).

## Dependencies

This script uses the `tkinter` library for creating the GUI. `tkinter` is included with most Python installations, so no additional installations are required.

# Convert Numbers to Words

## Overview

This Python script converts numerical values into their corresponding word representations. It handles a wide range of numbers, including large sums and negative values, transforming them into a textual format.

## Purpose

The script's primary purpose is to provide a tool for converting numerical data into a readable word format. This can be useful for applications such as check writing software, educational tools, or any scenario where numbers need to be presented in a more comprehensible, text-based form.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- No additional modules are required beyond the standard Python library.

## How to Run the Script

1. Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system.
2. Download the script to your local machine.
3. Run the script in a Python environment:

   ```bash
   python converter.py
   ```

4. When prompted, enter a number to convert it into words or type 'exit' to stop the script.

## Script Details

### Functionality

- Converts entered numbers into their word equivalents.
- Handles both positive and negative numbers as well as large numbers up to nonillions.
- Includes special cases for numbers like ten, eleven, and twelve, and handles 'teen' and 'ty' suffixes correctly.

### Usage Example

```bash
Enter any number to convert it into words or 'exit' to stop: 12345
12345 --> Twelve thousand three hundred forty-five
```

The script will display the number in word format. If an invalid number is entered, it will prompt an error message.

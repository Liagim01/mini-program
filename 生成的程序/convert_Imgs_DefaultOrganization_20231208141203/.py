The highest priority comment is that the code is missing the import statement for the `os` module in the `main.py` file. This module is used to perform file operations, such as joining file paths and removing files. To fix this, add the following import statement at the beginning of the `main.py` file:
import os
Once this import statement is added, the code will be able to use the `os` module for file operations.

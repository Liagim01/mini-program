# Ball Bounce Simulation User Manual

## Introduction

The Ball Bounce Simulation is a program that simulates the motion of multiple balls bouncing inside a container under gravitational acceleration. The program uses the Pygame module for graphical rendering and allows users to adjust the properties of the balls, such as mass, velocity, and size.

This user manual provides instructions on how to install the necessary dependencies, run the program, and interact with the simulation.

## 1. Installation

Before running the Ball Bounce Simulation, you need to ensure that you have Python 3 and the Pygame module installed on your system. Follow the steps below to install the required dependencies:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Check if Python 3 is installed by running the following command:
   ```
   python3 --version
   ```
   If Python 3 is not installed, download and install the latest version from the official Python website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

3. Install the Pygame module by running the following command:
   ```
   pip install pygame
   ```

## 2. Running the Program

To run the Ball Bounce Simulation, follow the steps below:

1. Download the `ball_bounce.py` and `ball.py` files from the provided source code.

2. Open a terminal or command prompt.

3. Navigate to the directory where the `ball_bounce.py` file is located.

4. Run the following command to start the simulation:
   ```
   python ball_bounce.py
   ```

5. The simulation window will open, showing the balls bouncing inside the container.

## 3. Adjusting Ball Properties

The Ball Bounce Simulation allows you to adjust the properties of the individual balls. Follow the instructions below to modify the ball properties:

- **Mass**: Press the **UP** arrow key to increase the mass of the first ball. Press the **DOWN** arrow key to decrease the mass of the first ball.

## 4. Exiting the Program

To exit the Ball Bounce Simulation, follow the steps below:

1. Close the simulation window by clicking the close button or pressing the **X** button.

2. The program will terminate, and you can close the terminal or command prompt.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You have successfully installed and run the Ball Bounce Simulation program. You can now enjoy watching the balls bounce inside the container and experiment with adjusting their properties.

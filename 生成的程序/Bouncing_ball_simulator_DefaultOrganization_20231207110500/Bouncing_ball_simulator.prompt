Instructions This program shows the simulation of 5 balls bouncing inside a container under gravitational acceleration. When the balls collide with the walls and bottom of the container, they bounce and change direction.   Requirements This program requires the latest version of Python 3 to be installed. Additionally, the Pygame module must also be installed and present in the current environment. To ensure a successful simulation, you must install the requirements listed in the requirements.txt file.  Main Program Flow The main file of the program is ball_bounce.py. This file contains the main program loop, which starts running when the program is launched and handles the logic for rendering and updating the individual ball objects. The design of this loop dynamically handles any new ball objects that are added to the list through code.  Modules and Classes The modules and classes of this program are found in the ball_bounce.py file. The main module is the ball class, which holds all of the properties for each individual ball and handles the movement and collision logic. The program also contains the main loop as well as ageitalized functions for launching the program, loading resources, and handling collisions.   Data Structures The program uses a list of balls as the primary data structure. This list allows for easy access and management of multiple ball objects in a single container.  Input and Output The program allows for user input to adjust the properties of the individual ball objects, such as mass, velocity, and size. The program also prints out information regarding ball collisions and other program events.   Exception Handling The program handles potential errors by outputting error messages to the terminal. If an error occurs, the program will halt and notify the user.  External Libraries and Dependencies The program uses the Pygame module to handle all graphical rendering. This library requires the latest version of Python 3 and must be installed prior to running the program.

## Instructions to Create Website Status Checker Program  The following instructions describe the process for creating a Python-based website status checker program. This program will take a list of websites (saved in a text file) and process them to determine whether each website is working or not and output the results to a CSV file.  ### Prerequisites  - Python 3.x installed on your system. - The equests library installed. To install equests, open a command window (cmd or terminal) and run pip install requests. This will install the equests module in your Python configuration.  ### Step 1: Create the Configuration Files  1. Create a text file in your working directory and name it websites.txt. This file will be used to store your list of websites. 2. Populate this text file with the URLs of the websites you want to check.    ### Step 2: Create the Python Script  1. Create a new file in your working directory and name it check_website_status.py. This file will contain the Python code for the website status checker program. 2. Copy the provided code from check_website_status.py and paste it into the file you just created.    ### Step 3: Run the Program  1. Ensure Python 3.x and the equests library are installed. 2. Run the script using the following command:     `ash    python check_website_status.py    `  3. After the program finishes executing, it will create a website_status.csv file which contains the operational statuses of the websites you listed in websites.txt.

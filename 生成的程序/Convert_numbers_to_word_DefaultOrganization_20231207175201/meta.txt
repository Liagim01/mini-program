Task:
Instructions: This program is a Python script that converts numerical values to their corresponding word representations. It takes in any numerical value, whether it is positive, negative, or of a large sum, and converts it into a text-based format that is easier to read. As it takes numbers in a wide range, it can be useful for applications such as check writing software and educational tools.   To use this program, users will need to have Python 3.x installed on their local machine. Once the script has been downloaded, it can be run in a Python environment: python converter.py and when prompted, enter a number to convert it into words or type 'exit' to stop the script.   The script utilizes a wide variety of features to provide a reliable and comprehensive conversion tool. These include handling 'teen' and 'ty'  suffixes correctly and including special cases for numbers like ten, eleven, and twelve. If an invalid number is entered into the script, an error message will be prompted.  The expected outputs of the program are the numerical value converted into a word format, as well as an error message should an invalid number be entered. The program will also provide exception handling to ensure its stability and robustness, as well as no additional libraries beyond the standard Python library.

Task:
Instructions to recreate the program: This program transforms an image into ASCII art, a form of artwork composed of ASCII characters. It uses OpenCV and NumPy to read and resize the input image and generate an ASCII output   This program requires the Python 3.x interpreter. In addition, please make sure to install the Python packages OpenCV and NumPy to ensure proper functioning of the program.  Once these dependencies have been installed, you can run the make_art.py script to generate your ASCII art.  When running the script, you can provide it with the absolute path to an input image. If no image is specified, the program will use the default image 'sample_image.png'. It then converts the image into ASCII symbols based on brightness level.   The program features two main customization options: symbols_list and thresholds_list. Both lists can be edited to alter the symbols used to represent the  brightness levels and the numerical values assigned to them respectively.  Upon completion, the output will be printed in the command line or terminal. The generated ASCII art should resemble the input image, although the effectiveness of the transformation may vary depending on image resolution and contrast.  For additional information or help with the program, refer to the instructions in the README.md file.

Instructions to Recreate Program:  This Python program calculates the Intersection over Union (IoU) between two bounding boxes. IoU is a crucial metric in computer vision, particularly in object detection tasks. The program requires Python 3.x and NumPy library, which can be installed via pip.   To run the program, download it and run the following command in the terminal:  python Compute_IoU.py   To calculate IoU, enter the coordinates of the predicted and ground truth bounding boxes in the 'pred_bbox' and 'gt_bbox' variables. The program returns a value for the IoU between 0 (no overlap) and 1 (perfect overlap).   Potential errors and exceptions are handled to ensure the stability and robustness of the program.

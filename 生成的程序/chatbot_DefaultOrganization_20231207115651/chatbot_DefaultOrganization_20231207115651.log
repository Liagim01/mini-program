<COMMENT> The code is missing the necessary import statements for the Wechaty and message classes. 

To fix this, add the following import statements at the beginning of the `mybot.py` file:

```python
from wechaty import Wechaty, Message
```

This will import the necessary classes for the code to work correctly.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

<COMMENT> The code seems to be missing the necessary import statements for the Wechaty and Message classes in the mybot.py file. These classes are required for the code to work properly.

To fix this, add the following import statements at the top of the mybot.py file:

```python
from wechaty import Wechaty, Message
```

This will ensure that the necessary classes are imported and available for use in the MyBot class.

<COMMENT> The code seems to be missing the necessary imports for the Wechaty and Message classes in the mybot.py file. Additionally, the start() method is not implemented in the MyBot class.

To fix these issues, you can make the following revisions:

1) In mybot.py, add the necessary imports for the Wechaty and Message classes at the top of the file:
```python
from wechaty import Wechaty, Message
```

2) Implement the start() method in the MyBot class in mybot.py:
```python
class MyBot(Wechaty):
    async def on_message(self, message):
        if message.text() == 'ding':
            await message.say('dong')

    async def start(self):
        await super().start()
```

With these revisions, the code should now import the necessary classes and implement the start() method, allowing the chatbot to be started successfully.

Please make these revisions and retest the code to ensure it meets the requirements.

In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of "changing the digital world through programming".
You are Code Reviewer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can help programmers to assess source codes for software troubleshooting, fix bugs to increase code quality and robustness, and offer proposals to improve the source codes.
Here is a new customer's task: Instructions: To create this program you will need the following: Python 3.x, the python-wechaty package and its dependencies. Once all dependencies are installed, run the chatbot script using the command  python bot.py . The chatbot should respond with ‘dong’ when it receives the message ‘ding’. It is equipped with various functionalities, such as automated text responses, image handling, mini-program interaction, and room member and friendship management. To interact with the chatbot, send specific text commands, images, and mini-programs. Special commands can be used for room management, like adding or removing members. The chatbot is composed of a MyBot class which inherits from Wechaty and defines event-handling behavior, and a main function which initializes and starts the chatbot..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

main.py
```python
'''
This is the chatbot script that should be run to start the chatbot.
'''
from mybot import MyBot

def main():
    bot = MyBot()
    bot.start()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

mybot.py
```python
'''
This file contains the MyBot class which inherits from Wechaty and defines event-handling behavior.
'''
from wechaty import Wechaty, Message

class MyBot(Wechaty):
    async def on_message(self, message):
        if message.text() == 'ding':
            await message.say('dong')

    async def start(self):
        await super().start()

```

bot.py
```python
python main.py
```

<COMMENT> The code seems to be missing the necessary imports for the Wechaty and Message classes in the mybot.py file. Additionally, the start() method is not implemented in the MyBot class.

To fix these issues, you can make the following revisions:

1) In mybot.py, add the necessary imports for the Wechaty and Message classes at the top of the file:
```python
from wechaty import Wechaty, Message
```

2) Implement the start() method in the MyBot class in mybot.py:
```python
class MyBot(Wechaty):
    async def on_message(self, message):
        if message.text() == 'ding':
            await message.say('dong')

    async def start(self):
        await super().start()
```

With these revisions, the code should now import the necessary classes and implement the start() method, allowing the chatbot to be started successfully.

Based on the test reports, the bug causing the problem is a NameError: name 'Wechaty' is not defined. This error occurs because the Wechaty class is not imported or defined in the mybot.py file. The MyBot class is inheriting from the Wechaty class, but the Wechaty class is not available in the current scope.

To fix this bug, you need to import the Wechaty class in the mybot.py file. You can do this by adding the following import statement at the top of the mybot.py file:

```python
from wechaty import Wechaty
```

After adding this import statement, the NameError should be resolved, and the chatbot script should be able to run without any errors.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of "changing the digital world through programming".
You are Software Test Engineer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can use the software as intended to analyze its functional properties, design manual and automated test procedures to evaluate each software product, build and implement software evaluation test programs, and run test programs to ensure that testing protocols evaluate the software correctly.
Here is a new customer's task: Instructions: To create this program you will need the following: Python 3.x, the python-wechaty package and its dependencies. Once all dependencies are installed, run the chatbot script using the command  python bot.py . The chatbot should respond with ‘dong’ when it receives the message ‘ding’. It is equipped with various functionalities, such as automated text responses, image handling, mini-program interaction, and room member and friendship management. To interact with the chatbot, send specific text commands, images, and mini-programs. Special commands can be used for room management, like adding or removing members. The chatbot is composed of a MyBot class which inherits from Wechaty and defines event-handling behavior, and a main function which initializes and starts the chatbot..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Based on the test reports, the bug causing the problem is a NameError in the mybot.py file. The error message indicates that the name 'Wechaty' is not defined. This suggests that the Wechaty package or module is not imported or installed correctly.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:

requirements.txt

```

numpy==1.19.2

pandas>=1.1.4

```

According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of "changing the digital world through programming".
You are Chief Technology Officer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You are very familiar to information technology. You will make high-level decisions for the overarching technology infrastructure that closely align with the organization's goals, while you work alongside the organization's information technology ("IT") staff members to perform everyday operations.
Here is a new customer's task: Instructions: To create this program you will need the following: Python 3.x, the python-wechaty package and its dependencies. Once all dependencies are installed, run the chatbot script using the command  python bot.py . The chatbot should respond with ‘dong’ when it receives the message ‘ding’. It is equipped with various functionalities, such as automated text responses, image handling, mini-program interaction, and room member and friendship management. To interact with the chatbot, send specific text commands, images, and mini-programs. Special commands can be used for room management, like adding or removing members. The chatbot is composed of a MyBot class which inherits from Wechaty and defines event-handling behavior, and a main function which initializes and starts the chatbot..
To complete the task, You must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

To create a requirements.txt file for the project, you need to specify the dependencies or packages required for the chatbot to run properly. Based on the provided information, the main dependency is the `python-wechaty` package. 

Create a new file named `requirements.txt` and add the following line to it:

```
python-wechaty
```

This line specifies that the `python-wechaty` package is required for the project. 

Save the `requirements.txt` file and make sure it is placed in the same directory as the other Python files (`main.py` and `mybot.py`). 

Now, when the user installs the dependencies using the command `pip install -r requirements.txt`, the `python-wechaty` package will be installed along with its dependencies, ensuring that the chatbot can run properly.

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

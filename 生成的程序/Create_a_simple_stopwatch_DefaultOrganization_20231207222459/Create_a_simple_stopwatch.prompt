Instructions  This program creates a simple stopwatch using Python, the Tkinter library, and the datetime library. It allows users to start, stop, and reset the stopwatch.  To use the stopwatch, open your terminal and run the command python stopwatch.py. This will open a graphical user interface window displaying the stopwatch.  The stopwatch contains three main features:  - Start: clicking the \ Start\  button will begin the stopwatch, causing it to start counting up. - Stop: clicking the \ Stop\  button will pause the stopwatch. The user can resume the stopwatch by clicking \ Start\  again. - Reset: clicking the \ Reset\  button will reset the stopwatch to 00:00:00.   The stopwatch will display the elapsed time in hours, minutes, and seconds format (HH:MM:SS).  This script requires the Tkinter library, which is included with most Python installations. External libraries and dependencies are not required.  Exception handling is built into the program, and potential errors or exceptions should be handled to ensure the stability and robustness of the program.

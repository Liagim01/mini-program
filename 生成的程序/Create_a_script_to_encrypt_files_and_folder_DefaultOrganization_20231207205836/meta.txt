Task:
INSTRUCTIONS  This program allows users to encrypt files and/or folders using the AES encryption algorithm. The program requires the installation of the Pycryptodome library. To install, open the terminal and run the following command:  `ash pip install pycryptodome ` Once the library is installed, you can use the encrypt.py script to encrypt files and folders. To encrypt a file, open the terminal and navigate to the location of the encrypt.py file, then run the following command:  `ash python encrypt.py filepath `  Replace ilepath with the path of the file to be encrypted. If the provided filepath is a valid folder, all the files and subfolders in the folder will be encrypted recursively. The encrypted files will be given the same name as the original files, but with a .bin extension.  Please note that the encryption key ('this is a 16 key') used in the encrypt.py file is hardcoded. For security reasons, you may want to enhance the key management by securely storing or generating keys. The script will detect and skip special files (e.g., sockets, FIFOs, and device files) during the encryption process.

Task:
INSTRUCTIONS TO RECREATE THE AUDIOBOOK GENERATOR 1. Access a computer enabled with the Python 3 language. 2. Install the Google Text to Speech library and PyPDF2 library by executing these commands on the terminal: `ash pip install gtts pip install PyPDF2 ` 3. Place the PDF file you wish to convert into an audio book in the same directory as the Audio-book.py file. Alternatively, provide the full path to the file. 4. Open the terminal window and access the directory containing the file. 5. Run the Audio-book.py file by executing: `ash python Audio-book.py ` 6. The script will read the text from the PDF file and convert it into an MP3 file. The resulting MP3 file, named Audio.mp3, will be saved in the same directory. 7. If needed, modify the language variable to support other languages than English. Also, to control the speed of speech, set the slow variable to True or False. 8. For batch processing, the script is capable of processing multiple pages from a PDF file. 9. Note that depending on the layout and formatting of the PDF file, text extraction may be less effective.

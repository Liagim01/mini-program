Instructions to Recreate the Program  1. Modules and Classes: You will need several modules for this program, including ‘tensorflow’, ‘keras’, ‘nltk’, ‘numpy’, ‘sklearn’, ‘random’, and ‘matplotlib’. The classes you need include ‘Classifier’, ‘Tokenizer’, ‘Preprocessor’, and ‘DataLoader’. Each class has several attributes and methods to preprocess data, process inputs, tokenize text, and classify data.  2. Data Structures: The key data structures used in the code are dictionaries, lists, and arrays. The dictionaries are used to store the data, the lists contain the tokenized text, and the arrays represent the data points after preprocessing.  3. Main Program Flow: The main program flow begins with initializing the modules and classes, followed by loading input data. The data is then preprocessed and split into training and testing sets. Tokenizing is then done to create inputs for the classifier. Finally, the classification is performed and output results are obtained.  4. Input and Output: The program accepts input in the form of unstructured data, usually in the form of text. The output from the program is a prediction based on the input data.  5. Exception Handling: The program performs exception handling by checking user input data for invalid values and detecting any errors that arise during the execution of the program.  6. External Libraries and Dependencies: This program requires the following external libraries and dependencies: ‘tensorflow’, ‘keras’, ‘nltk’, ‘numpy’, ‘sklearn’, ‘random’, and ‘matplotlib’. These libraries and dependencies help with data preprocessing, tokenizing text, and classifying data.

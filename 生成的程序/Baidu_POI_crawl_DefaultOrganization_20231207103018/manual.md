# ChatDev Program Recreation Instructions

## Introduction
This document provides instructions on how to recreate the program developed by ChatDev for the new customer. The program is designed to preprocess data, tokenize text, and classify data using machine learning techniques. The program is written in Python and requires several external libraries and dependencies.

## Installation
To recreate the program, follow these steps:

1. Install Python: Make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

2. Install required libraries: Open a terminal or command prompt and run the following command to install the required libraries and dependencies:
```
pip install tensorflow keras nltk numpy sklearn matplotlib
```

## Program Structure
The program consists of several modules and classes. Here is an overview of the modules and classes used in the program:

### Modules
- tensorflow: Provides machine learning capabilities for building and training models.
- keras: A high-level neural networks API that runs on top of TensorFlow.
- nltk: A natural language processing library for tokenizing text.
- numpy: A library for numerical computing.
- sklearn: A machine learning library for data preprocessing and model evaluation.
- random: A library for generating random numbers.
- matplotlib: A library for data visualization.

### Classes
- Classifier: Handles the classification task using a neural network model.
- Tokenizer: Tokenizes text using the nltk library.
- Preprocessor: Preprocesses data by normalizing and splitting it.
- DataLoader: Loads input data for the program.

## Program Flow
The main program flow can be summarized as follows:

1. Initialize modules and classes: Create instances of the Classifier, Tokenizer, Preprocessor, and DataLoader classes.

2. Load input data: Use the DataLoader class to load input data. The input data should be in the form of unstructured text.

3. Preprocess and split data: Use the Preprocessor class to preprocess the input data. This includes normalizing the data and splitting it into training and testing sets.

4. Tokenize text: Use the Tokenizer class to tokenize the text data. This converts the text into a list of tokens.

5. Perform classification: Use the Classifier class to perform the classification task. This involves training a neural network model on the tokenized text data and making predictions.

6. Output results: Print or display the output results, which are the predictions made by the classifier.

## Exception Handling
The program performs exception handling to ensure the validity of user input data and to handle any errors that may occur during program execution. It checks for invalid values in the input data and uses try-except blocks to catch and handle any exceptions that arise.

## Recreating the Program
To recreate the program, follow these steps:

1. Create a new Python file, e.g., `main.py`.

2. Copy the code provided in the `main.py` file from the codes section of this document.

3. Create separate Python files for each class: `classifier.py`, `tokenizer.py`, `preprocessor.py`, and `data_loader.py`.

4. Copy the code provided for each class into their respective files.

5. Save all the files in the same directory.

6. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the files are saved.

7. Run the following command to execute the program:
```
python main.py
```

8. The program will load the input data, preprocess it, tokenize it, perform classification, and output the results.

## Conclusion
By following these instructions, you will be able to recreate the program developed by ChatDev for the new customer. The program utilizes various modules and classes to preprocess data, tokenize text, and classify data. Make sure to install the required libraries and dependencies before running the program.

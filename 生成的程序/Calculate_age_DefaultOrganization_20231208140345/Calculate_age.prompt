Instructions to Recreate the Program: This program is used to calculate a person’s age in three different units: years, months, and days. There are several steps needed in order to recreate this program. First, ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system. This can be done by downloading Python from the official website. Second, download the script for the program and save it in a directory. Third, open a terminal and navigate to the directory and execute the script using the following command python calculate.py. The script contains two functions, judge_leap_year(year) and month_days(month, leap_year), which are used to determine if a year is a leap year and to calculate the amount of days in a given month, respectively. User interaction for this script includes inputting a name and age. Once entered, the program will calculate the age in years, months, and days and display it to the user. An example use of the program is shown below: `ash $ python calculate.py input your name: John input your age: 25 John s age is 25 years or 306 months or 9300 days ` Finally, the program incorporates exception handling to ensure the stability and robustness of the code. The program uses the built-in modules from Python, 	ime and calendar, in order to build its functionality. These modules provide useful classes and methods to correctly calculate the age and help execute the program. In conclusion, this program aims to provide an interesting way to calculate a user’s age in three different units and generate program output accordingly.

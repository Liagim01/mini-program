# Age Calculator User Manual

## Introduction

The Age Calculator is a Python program that allows users to calculate their age in years, months, and days. It provides a simple and convenient way to determine how long someone has been alive.

## Installation

To use the Age Calculator, you need to ensure that Python 3.x is installed on your system. If you don't have Python installed, you can download it from the official website (https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Once Python is installed, you can follow these steps to set up the Age Calculator:

1. Download the script for the program and save it in a directory of your choice.

2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved the script.

3. Execute the script using the following command: `python calculate.py`

## Usage

After executing the script, you will be prompted to input your name and age. Follow the instructions on the terminal and provide the required information.

Example usage:

```
$ python calculate.py
Input your name: John
Input your age: 25
John's age is 25 years or 306 months or 9300 days
```

The program will then calculate your age in years, months, and days and display the result.

## Exception Handling

The Age Calculator incorporates exception handling to ensure the stability and robustness of the code. If you enter an invalid input for the age (e.g., a non-integer value), the program will display an error message and prompt you to enter a valid integer.

## Dependencies

The Age Calculator uses the built-in modules `datetime` and `calendar` from Python to perform its calculations. These modules provide useful classes and methods to correctly calculate the age and execute the program.

## Conclusion

The Age Calculator provides an interesting way to calculate a person's age in three different units: years, months, and days. It is a useful tool for anyone who wants to know how long they have been alive.

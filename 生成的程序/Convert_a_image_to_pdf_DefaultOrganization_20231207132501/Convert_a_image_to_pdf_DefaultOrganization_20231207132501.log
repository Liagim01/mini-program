Modality: "pdf".

Programming Language: " Python"

Ideas:""

We have decided to complete the task through a executable software with multiple files implemented via  Python. As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demands, you should write one or multiple files and make sure that every detail of the architecture is, in the end, implemented as code. The software should be equipped with graphical user interface (GUI) so that user can visually and graphically use it; so you must choose a GUI framework (e.g., in Python, you can implement GUI via tkinter, Pygame, Flexx, PyGUI, etc,).

Think step by step and reason yourself to the right decisions to make sure we get it right.

You will first lay out the names of the core classes, functions, methods that will be necessary, as well as a quick comment on their purpose.

Then you will output the content of each file including complete code. Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code:

FILENAME

```LANGUAGE

'''

DOCSTRING

'''

CODE

```

You will start with the "main" file, then go to the ones that are imported by that file, and so on.

Please note that the code should be fully functional. Ensure to implement all functions. No placeholders (such as 'pass' in Python).

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of "changing the digital world through programming".
You are Chief Technology Officer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You are very familiar to information technology. You will make high-level decisions for the overarching technology infrastructure that closely align with the organization's goals, while you work alongside the organization's information technology ("IT") staff members to perform everyday operations.
Here is a new customer's task: Instructions to run the Image to PDF Converter  This Python program converts JPG image files into PDF format. To use this script, you will need to have installed Python 3.x and the img2pdf module.  1) Download the script file and its required modules.  2) Place the JPG images in a known directory.  3) Run the script from the command line by providing the directory path containing the images as an argument:      python image_to_pdf_converter.py path_to_directory  4) The script will create an output.pdf file in the same directory where the script is located..
To complete the task, You must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

        self.root = root
        self.root.title("Image to PDF Converter")
        
        self.label = tk.Label(root, text="Select the directory containing the JPG images:")
        self.label.pack(pady=10)
        
        self.button = tk.Button(root, text="Browse", command=self.select_directory)

        self.status_label.pack(pady=10)
        
    def select_directory(self):

    def convert_to_pdf(self):
        if hasattr(self, 'directory'):
            images = [f for f in os.listdir(self.directory) if f.endswith('.jpg')]
            if images:
                output_pdf = os.path.join(self.directory, 'output.pdf')
                with open(output_pdf, "wb") as f:
                    f.write(img2pdf.convert([os.path.join(self.directory, image) for image in images]))
                self.status_label.config(text="Conversion successful. PDF saved as output.pdf")
            else:
                self.status_label.config(text="No JPG images found in the directory.")
        else:

if __name__ == "__main__":
    root = tk.Tk()
    app = ImageToPDFConverterApp(root)
    root.mainloop()

```

In the above code, we have implemented the main file `main.py` which contains the GUI implementation using the tkinter library. The `ImageToPDFConverterApp` class represents the application and handles the user interactions. The `select_directory` method is called when the user clicks the "Browse" button to select the directory containing the JPG images. The `convert_to_pdf` method is called when the user clicks the "Convert to PDF" button to convert the images to PDF format. The converted PDF is saved as `output.pdf` in the same directory. The status label is updated to show the progress and status of the conversion process.

Next, we will implement the `img2pdf` module which is required for the conversion process.

img2pdf.py

```python

'''

This file contains the img2pdf module which is used for converting images to PDF format.

'''

import img2pdf

# No code implementation is required as we are using the img2pdf module directly.

```

In the above code, we have created a separate file `img2pdf.py` which represents the `img2pdf` module. This module is responsible for converting the images to PDF format using the `img2pdf` library.

That completes the implementation of the Image to PDF Converter software. The user can now run the `main.py` file to launch the GUI and convert JPG images to PDF format.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

Here is a new customer's task: Instructions to run the Image to PDF Converter  This Python program converts JPG image files into PDF format. To use this script, you will need to have installed Python 3.x and the img2pdf module.  1) Download the script file and its required modules.  2) Place the JPG images in a known directory.  3) Run the script from the command line by providing the directory path containing the images as an argument:      python image_to_pdf_converter.py path_to_directory  4) The script will create an output.pdf file in the same directory where the script is located..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

<Comment>
The code looks well-structured and follows the instructions provided by the user. However, there is one potential issue that needs to be addressed:

In the `convert_to_pdf` method of the `ImageToPDFConverterApp` class, the code checks if the selected directory contains any JPG images before converting them to PDF. However, it does not handle the case where there are no JPG images found in the directory. 

To fix this, you can add an `else` block after the `if images:` condition and display a message to the user indicating that no JPG images were found in the directory.

Here's the revised code for the `convert_to_pdf` method:

```python
def convert_to_pdf(self):
    if hasattr(self, 'directory'):
        images = [f for f in os.listdir(self.directory) if f.endswith('.jpg')]
        if images:
            output_pdf = os.path.join(self.directory, 'output.pdf')
            with open(output_pdf, "wb") as f:
                f.write(img2pdf.convert([os.path.join(self.directory, image) for image in images]))
            self.status_label.config(text="Conversion successful. PDF saved as output.pdf")
        else:
            self.status_label.config(text="No JPG images found in the directory.")
    else:
        self.status_label.config(text="Please select a directory first.")
```

Please make this change to ensure that the user receives appropriate feedback when there are no JPG images in the selected directory.

Comments on Codes:
"<Comment>
The code looks well-structured and follows the instructions provided by the user. However, there is one potential issue that needs to be addressed:

In the `convert_to_pdf` method of the `ImageToPDFConverterApp` class, the code checks if the selected directory contains any JPG images before converting them to PDF. However, it does not handle the case where there are no JPG images found in the directory. 

To fix this, you can add an `else` block after the `if images:` condition and display a message to the user indicating that no JPG images were found in the directory.

Here's the revised code for the `convert_to_pdf` method:

```python
def convert_to_pdf(self):
    if hasattr(self, 'directory'):
        images = [f for f in os.listdir(self.directory) if f.endswith('.jpg')]
        if images:
            output_pdf = os.path.join(self.directory, 'output.pdf')
            with open(output_pdf, "wb") as f:
                f.write(img2pdf.convert([os.path.join(self.directory, image) for image in images]))
            self.status_label.config(text="Conversion successful. PDF saved as output.pdf")
        else:
            self.status_label.config(text="No JPG images found in the directory.")
    else:
        self.status_label.config(text="Please select a directory first.")
```

Please make this change to ensure that the user receives appropriate feedback when there are no JPG images in the selected directory."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:

```LANGUAGE

CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of "changing the digital world through programming".
You are Code Reviewer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can help programmers to assess source codes for software troubleshooting, fix bugs to increase code quality and robustness, and offer proposals to improve the source codes.
Here is a new customer's task: Instructions to run the Image to PDF Converter  This Python program converts JPG image files into PDF format. To use this script, you will need to have installed Python 3.x and the img2pdf module.  1) Download the script file and its required modules.  2) Place the JPG images in a known directory.  3) Run the script from the command line by providing the directory path containing the images as an argument:      python image_to_pdf_converter.py path_to_directory  4) The script will create an output.pdf file in the same directory where the script is located..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Comments on Codes:
```
The code looks well-structured and follows the instructions provided by the user. However, there is one potential issue that needs to be addressed:

In the `convert_to_pdf` method of the `ImageToPDFConverterApp` class, the code checks if the selected directory contains any JPG images before converting them to PDF. However, it does not handle the case where there are no JPG images found in the directory.

To fix this, you can add an `else` block after the `if images:` condition and display a message to the user indicating that no JPG images were found in the directory.

Here's the revised code for the `convert_to_pdf` method:

```python
def convert_to_pdf(self):
    if hasattr(self, 'directory'):
        images = [f for f in os.listdir(self.directory) if f.endswith('.jpg')]
        if images:
            output_pdf = os.path.join(self.directory, 'output.pdf')
            with open(output_pdf, "wb") as f:
                f.write(img2pdf.convert([os.path.join(self.directory, image) for image in images]))
            self.status_label.config(text="Conversion successful. PDF saved as output.pdf")
        else:
            self.status_label.config(text="No JPG images found in the directory.")
    else:
        self.status_label.config(text="Please select a directory first.")
```

Please make this change to ensure that the user receives appropriate feedback when there are no JPG images in the selected directory.

```python
The code looks well-structured and follows the instructions provided by the user. However, there is one potential issue that needs to be addressed:
In the `convert_to_pdf` method of the `ImageToPDFConverterApp` class, the code checks if the selected directory contains any JPG images before converting them to PDF. However, it does not handle the case where there are no JPG images found in the directory.
To fix this, you can add an `else` block after the `if images:` condition and display a message to the user indicating that no JPG images were found in the directory.
Here's the revised code for the `convert_to_pdf` method:
```

self.status_label
```status_label
Please make this change to ensure that the user receives appropriate feedback when there are no JPG images in the selected directory.
```

"
As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: Instructions to run the Image to PDF Converter  This Python program converts JPG image files into PDF format. To use this script, you will need to have installed Python 3.x and the img2pdf module.  1) Download the script file and its required modules.  2) Place the JPG images in a known directory.  3) Run the script from the command line by providing the directory path containing the images as an argument:      python image_to_pdf_converter.py path_to_directory  4) The script will create an output.pdf file in the same directory where the script is located..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

<Comment>
The code looks well-structured and follows the instructions provided by the user. However, there is one potential issue that needs to be addressed:
In the `convert_to_pdf` method of the `ImageToPDFConverterApp` class, the code checks if the selected directory contains any JPG images before converting them to PDF. However, it does not handle the case where there are no JPG images found in the directory.
To fix this, you can add an `else` block after the `if images:` condition and display a message to the user indicating that no JPG images were found in the directory.
Here's the revised code for the `convert_to_pdf` method:

```python
def convert_to_pdf(self):
    if hasattr(self, 'directory'):
        images = [f for f in os.listdir(self.directory) if f.endswith('.jpg')]
        if images:
            output_pdf = os.path.join(self.directory, 'output.pdf')
            with open(output_pdf, "wb") as f:
                f.write(img2pdf.convert([os.path.join(self.directory, image) for image in images]))
            self.status_label.config(text="Conversion successful. PDF saved as output.pdf")
        else:
            self.status_label.config(text="No JPG images found in the directory.")
    else:
        self.status_label.config(text="Please select a directory first.")
```

Please make this change to ensure that the user receives appropriate feedback when there are no JPG images in the selected directory.

In the `convert_to_pdf` method of the `ImageToPDFConverterApp` class, the code checks if the selected directory contains any JPG images before converting them to PDF. However, it does not handle the case where there are no JPG images found in the directory.
To fix this, you can add an `else` block after the `if images:` condition and display a message to the user indicating that no JPG images were found in the directory.

In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of "changing the digital world through programming".
You are Code Reviewer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can help programmers to assess source codes for software troubleshooting, fix bugs to increase code quality and robustness, and offer proposals to improve the source codes.
Here is a new customer's task: Instructions to run the Image to PDF Converter  This Python program converts JPG image files into PDF format. To use this script, you will need to have installed Python 3.x and the img2pdf module.  1) Download the script file and its required modules.  2) Place the JPG images in a known directory.  3) Run the script from the command line by providing the directory path containing the images as an argument:      python image_to_pdf_converter.py path_to_directory  4) The script will create an output.pdf file in the same directory where the script is located..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

The code looks well-structured and follows the instructions provided by the user. However, there is one potential issue that needs to be addressed:
In the `convert_to_pdf` method of the `ImageToPDFConverterApp` class, the code checks if the selected directory contains any JPG images before converting them to PDF. However, it does not handle the case where there are no JPG images found in the directory.
To fix this, you can add an `else` block after the `if images:` condition and display a message to the user indicating that no JPG images were found in the directory.
Here's the revised code for the `convert_to_pdf` method:
'''

 The code looks well-structured and follows the instructions provided by the user. However, there is one potential issue that needs to be addressed:
 In the `convert_to_pdf` method of the `ImageToPDFConverterApp` class, the code checks if the selected directory contains any JPG images before converting them to PDF. However, it does not handle the case where there are no JPG images found in the directory.
 To fix this, you can add an `else` block after the `if images:` condition and display a message to the user indicating that no JPG images were found in the directory.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of "changing the digital world through programming".
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: Instructions to run the Image to PDF Converter  This Python program converts JPG image files into PDF format. To use this script, you will need to have installed Python 3.x and the img2pdf module.  1) Download the script file and its required modules.  2) Place the JPG images in a known directory.  3) Run the script from the command line by providing the directory path containing the images as an argument:      python image_to_pdf_converter.py path_to_directory  4) The script will create an output.pdf file in the same directory where the script is located..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

<COMMENT> The code looks well-structured and follows the instructions provided by the user. However, there is one potential issue that needs to be addressed:

In the `convert_to_pdf` method of the `ImageToPDFConverterApp` class, the code checks if the selected directory contains any JPG images before converting them to PDF. However, it does not handle the case where there are no JPG images found in the directory.

To fix this, you can add an `else` block after the `if images:` condition and display a message to the user indicating that no JPG images were found in the directory.

Here's the revised code for the `convert_to_pdf` method:

```python
def convert_to_pdf(self):
    if hasattr(self, 'directory'):
        images = [f for f in os.listdir(self.directory) if f.endswith('.jpg')]
        if images:
            output_pdf = os.path.join(self.directory, 'output.pdf')
            with open(output_pdf, "wb") as f:
                f.write(img2pdf.convert([os.path.join(self.directory, image) for image in images]))
            self.status_label.config(text="Conversion successful. PDF saved as output.pdf")
        else:
            self.status_label.config(text="No JPG images found in the directory.")
    else:
        self.status_label.config(text="Please select a directory first.")
```

Please make this change to ensure that the user receives appropriate feedback when there are no JPG images in the selected directory.

In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:

As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of "changing the digital world through programming".
You are Code Reviewer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can help programmers to assess source codes for software troubleshooting, fix bugs to increase code quality and robustness, and offer proposals to improve the source codes.
Here is a new customer's task: Instructions to run the Image to PDF Converter  This Python program converts JPG image files into PDF format. To use this script, you will need to have installed Python 3.x and the img2pdf module.  1) Download the script file and its required modules.  2) Place the JPG images in a known directory.  3) Run the script from the command line by providing the directory path containing the images as an argument:      python image_to_pdf_converter.py path_to_directory  4) The script will create an output.pdf file in the same directory where the script is located..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

The code looks well-structured and follows the instructions provided by the user. However, there is one potential issue that needs to be addressed:

In the `convert_to_pdf` method of the `ImageToPDFConverterApp` class, the code checks if the selected directory contains any JPG images before converting them to PDF. However, it does not handle the case where there are no JPG images found in the directory.

To fix this, you can add an `else` block after the `if images:` condition and display a message to the user indicating that no JPG images were found in the directory.

Here's the revised code for the `convert_to_pdf` method:

```python
def convert_to_pdf(self):
    if hasattr(self, 'directory'):
        images = [f for f in os.listdir(self.directory) if f.endswith('.jpg')]
        if images:
            output_pdf = os.path.join(self.directory, 'output.pdf')
            with open(output_pdf, "wb") as f:
                f.write(img2pdf.convert([os.path.join(self.directory, image) for image in images]))
            self.status_label.config(text="Conversion successful. PDF saved as output.pdf")

    else:

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:

requirements.txt

```

numpy==1.19.2

pandas>=1.1.4

```

According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of "changing the digital world through programming".
You are Chief Technology Officer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You are very familiar to information technology. You will make high-level decisions for the overarching technology infrastructure that closely align with the organization's goals, while you work alongside the organization's information technology ("IT") staff members to perform everyday operations.
Here is a new customer's task: Instructions to run the Image to PDF Converter  This Python program converts JPG image files into PDF format. To use this script, you will need to have installed Python 3.x and the img2pdf module.  1) Download the script file and its required modules.  2) Place the JPG images in a known directory.  3) Run the script from the command line by providing the directory path containing the images as an argument:      python image_to_pdf_converter.py path_to_directory  4) The script will create an output.pdf file in the same directory where the script is located..
To complete the task, You must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

To specify the dependencies or packages required for the Image to PDF Converter project to run properly, you can create a requirements.txt file. In this case, the required module is `img2pdf`. Here's an example of how the requirements.txt file should look like:

requirements.txt

```
img2pdf==0.4.1
```

In this example, we specify the `img2pdf` module and its version (`0.4.1`) as the only requirement for the project. You can create a requirements.txt file in a text editor and save it in the same directory as the main.py file.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: To specify the dependencies or packages required for the Image to PDF Converter project to run properly, you can create a requirements.txt file. In this case, the required module is `img2pdf`. Here's an example of how the requirements.txt file should look like:
requirements.txt
```
img2pdf==0.4.1
```
In this example, we specify the `img2pdf` module and its version (`0.4.1`) as the only requirement for the project. You can create a requirements.txt file in a text editor and save it in the same directory as the main.py file. According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly."

For example: manual.md ``` LangChain Building applications with LLMs through composability Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js. Production Support: As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support. Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel. Quick Install pip install langchain or conda install langchain -c conda-forge 🤔 What is this? Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge. This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include: ❓ Question Answering over specific documents   Documentation   End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database   🤖 Agents   Documentation   End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha   📖 Documentation Please see here for full documentation on:   Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)   How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)   Reference (full API docs)   Resources (high-level explanation of core concepts)   ``` |

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation

Please see [here](https://python.langchain.com) for full documentation on:

- Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)

- How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)

To use the Image to PDF Converter, you need to have Python 3.x and the img2pdf module installed on your system. Follow the steps below to install the required dependencies:

1. Download the script file and its required modules.
2. Open a command prompt or terminal.
3. Navigate to the directory where you downloaded the script file.
4. Run the following command to install the img2pdf module:
   ```
   pip install img2pdf
   ```

## 2. Usage
Once you have installed the required dependencies, you can use the Image to PDF Converter by following these steps:

1. Place the JPG images that you want to convert into a known directory.
2. Open a command prompt or terminal.
3. Navigate to the directory where you downloaded the script file.
4. Run the following command, replacing `path_to_directory` with the actual path to the directory containing the images:
   ```
   python image_to_pdf_converter.py path_to_directory
   ```
5. The script will convert the JPG images into a PDF file named `output.pdf` and save it in the same directory where the script is located.

## 3. Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues while using the Image to PDF Converter, consider the following troubleshooting tips:

- Make sure you have Python 3.x installed on your system. You can check the version by running the following command:
  ```

We have decided to complete the task through a executable software with multiple files implemented via  Python. As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demands, you should write one or multiple files and make sure that every detail of the architecture is, in the end, implemented as code. The software should be equipped with graphical user interface (GUI) so that user can visually and graphically use it; so you must choose a GUI framework (e.g., in Python, you can implement GUI via tkinter, Pygame, Flexx, PyGUI, etc,).

Think step by step and reason yourself to the right decisions to make sure we get it right.

You will first lay out the names of the core classes, functions, methods that will be necessary, as well as a quick comment on their purpose.

Then you will output the content of each file including complete code. Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code:

You will start with the "main" file, then go to the ones that are imported by that file, and so on.

<Comment>
The code looks good overall, but there is one potential improvement that can be made. In the `calculate` method of the `Calculator` class, the `eval` function is used to evaluate the mathematical expression entered by the user. However, using `eval` can be risky as it allows the execution of arbitrary code. It is recommended to use a safer alternative, such as the `ast.literal_eval` function, which only evaluates literal expressions.

To fix this, you can replace the line `result = eval(expression)` with `result = ast.literal_eval(expression)` and add the following import statement at the top of the `calculator.py` file:

```python
import ast
```

This will ensure that the mathematical expression is safely evaluated without the risk of executing arbitrary code.

Once you make this change, the code will be more secure and robust.

Comments on Codes:
"<Comment>
The code looks good overall, but there is one potential improvement that can be made. In the `calculate` method of the `Calculator` class, the `eval` function is used to evaluate the mathematical expression entered by the user. However, using `eval` can be risky as it allows the execution of arbitrary code. It is recommended to use a safer alternative, such as the `ast.literal_eval` function, which only evaluates literal expressions.

To fix this, you can replace the line `result = eval(expression)` with `result = ast.literal_eval(expression)` and add the following import statement at the top of the `calculator.py` file:

```python
import ast
```

This will ensure that the mathematical expression is safely evaluated without the risk of executing arbitrary code.

Once you make this change, the code will be more secure and robust.

"
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

 Chief Technology Officer: Thank you for providing the necessary information. Based on the codes and file format provided, the `requirements.txt` file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly would be as follows:

```
tkinter==8.6
```

This file specifies that the application requires the `tkinter` package with version 8.6. The `tkinter` package is a standard Python package that provides a graphical user interface (GUI) toolkit.

Please note that `tkinter` is a built-in package in Python 3, so you don't need to install it separately. However, specifying it in the `requirements.txt` file can serve as documentation for the project's dependencies.

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation

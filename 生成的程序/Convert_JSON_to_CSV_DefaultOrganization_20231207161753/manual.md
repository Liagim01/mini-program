# JSON to CSV Converter

The JSON to CSV Converter is a Python application that allows you to convert a JSON file to a CSV file format. This can be useful when you have data in JSON format and you need to work with it in a spreadsheet or other CSV-compatible application.

## Installation

To use the JSON to CSV Converter, you need to have Python 3.x installed on your computer. If you don't have Python installed, you can download it from the official website of the Python Software Foundation (https://www.python.org).

## Usage

Follow the steps below to convert a JSON file to CSV using the JSON to CSV Converter:

1. Create a valid JSON file containing comma-separated values (CSV) and save it as 'input.json'. Make sure the JSON file is properly formatted and contains the data you want to convert.

2. Place the 'input.json' file in the same directory as the 'converter.py' script. This is important because the script will look for the JSON file in the same directory.

3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the 'converter.py' script is located.

4. Run the script by executing the following command:

   ```
   python converter.py
   ```

   This will start the conversion process and generate an 'output.csv' file in the same directory as the script.

5. Once the conversion is complete, you can open the 'output.csv' file in a spreadsheet or any CSV-compatible application to view and work with the converted data.

## Important Notes

- The JSON to CSV Converter does not require any additional modules or dependencies outside of the standard Python library. You only need to have Python 3.x installed on your computer.

- It is important to ensure that the 'input.json' file is valid and properly formatted before running the script. Any errors or issues with the JSON file will be recorded within the program during use.

- If the 'input.json' file is not found or there are any other errors during the conversion process, the script will display an appropriate error message.

## Example

Here is an example of how to use the JSON to CSV Converter:

1. Create a JSON file named 'input.json' with the following content:

   ```json
   [
     {
       "name": "John Doe",
       "age": 30,
       "email": "johndoe@example.com"
     },
     {
       "name": "Jane Smith",
       "age": 25,
       "email": "janesmith@example.com"
     }
   ]
   ```

2. Save the 'input.json' file in the same directory as the 'converter.py' script.

3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the 'converter.py' script is located.

4. Run the script by executing the following command:

   ```
   python converter.py
   ```

5. The script will generate an 'output.csv' file in the same directory as the script with the following content:

   ```csv
   name,age,email
   John Doe,30,johndoe@example.com
   Jane Smith,25,janesmith@example.com
   ```

6. You can now open the 'output.csv' file in a spreadsheet or any CSV-compatible application to view and work with the converted data.

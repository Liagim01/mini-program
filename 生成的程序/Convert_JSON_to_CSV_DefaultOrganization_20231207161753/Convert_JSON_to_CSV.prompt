Instructions:  This program provides the ability to convert a JSON file to a CSV file format. In order to use the program, the following steps are required:   1. Install the Python 3.x environment. This can be done through the official website, available through the Python Software Foundation.  2. Create a valid JSON file containing comma-separated values (CSV) and save it as 'input.json'.  3. Place the JSON file in the same directory as the script.  4. Run the script 'converter.py' within the Python 3.x environment.  5. The script will generate an 'output.csv' file in the same directory as the script.  Note: No additional modules are required for the program outside of the standard Python library. It is important to ensure that the 'input.json' is valid prior to running the script. Any errors will be recorded within the program during use.

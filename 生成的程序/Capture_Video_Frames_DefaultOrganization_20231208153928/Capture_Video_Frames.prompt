Instructions: This program enables users to capture frames from a specified video file. The captured frames are stored in a directory specified by the user. The program makes use of the openCV library, to which users must have pre-installed access. 1. Install the external library: Install openCV version 4.3.0.36 or a compatible version for your system, if you have not done so: - On Linux: Use the command-line package manager apt-get or pip install to install openCV. - On Mac: Use the command-line package manager homebrew or pip install to install openCV. - On Windows: Use the command-line package manager choco, the build tool Visual Studio, or pip install to install openCV. 2. Create an instance of the FrameCapture class: Create an instance of the FrameCapture class for which we provide the video input file path as parameter. 3. Call the capture_frames method: Call the capture_frames method of the FrameCapture class object to capture frames from the video file and store them in the specified directory. 4. Error handling: If an error is encountered at any point (e.g., if the file path is invalid or if openCV fails to capture frames), this program will terminate. To prevent this, ensure that the video file path provided is valid. Check for any potential errors that can be thrown by openCV during the capture process. If any errors are encountered, catch them and provide warnings to the user and, if necessary, terminate the program gracefully.
